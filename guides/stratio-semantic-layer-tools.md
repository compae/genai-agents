# Stratio Semantic Layer MCP Usage Guide

> **Companion guide.** For `task_id` polling and large output truncation — both can occur on any MCP tool below, on either the `gov` or `sql` server — see `stratio-mcp-response-patterns.md`. Quick reference in §9.

## 1. Fundamental Rule

**The agent never modifies the data model directly.** It operates through governance MCP tools that use internal AI to generate content (descriptions, ontologies, SQL mappings, semantic terms). The agent orchestrates, plans, validates, and provides context — the tools do the generation work.

## 2. Available MCP Tools

### `gov` Server (governance)

| Category | MCP Tool | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Ontology** | `search_ontologies(search_text)` | Search ontologies by free text (name or description). Results by relevance. Use when part of the name is known |
| | `list_ontologies` | List all existing ontologies |
| | `get_ontology_info(name)` | Structure of classes, data properties, and relationships of an ontology |
| | `create_ontology(domain, name, ontology_plan, best_effort?)` | Create a new ontology with a Markdown plan. Optional `best_effort` (bool, default off): deliver the last attempted result anyway if the chain can't fully validate the generated classes/views after all retries + plan rebuilds. Pending feedback is surfaced as a `` `Warning (best-effort):` `` line in the final message; the ontology is still persisted, so retrying in strict mode requires `delete_ontology` first. Pre-generation failures (plan deemed unachievable with the available tables, table/size caps exceeded, governance services unreachable) still fail the call regardless of the flag. When omitted, the deployment profile value applies; True/False overrides the profile |
| | `update_ontology(domain, name, update_plan, best_effort?)` | Add new classes to an existing ontology. Optional `best_effort` (bool, default off): same delivery semantics as `create_ontology`. Beware that update is ADD-only, so classes added in best-effort mode mix with pre-existing valid ones and can only be removed via `delete_ontology_classes(...)` or by deleting the whole ontology via `delete_ontology` and recreating |
| | `delete_ontology(ontology_name)` | DESTRUCTIVE: delete the entire ontology and all its classes (protected by Published). Use for the post-best-effort cleanup flow when the partial ontology must be wiped before recreating from scratch, or to clean up obsolete ontologies. For removing specific classes only, use `delete_ontology_classes` |
| | `delete_ontology_classes(ontology_name, class_names)` | DESTRUCTIVE: delete specific classes (protected by Published). Preferred over `delete_ontology` when the caller just needs to drop a few classes mixed in by a best-effort `update_ontology` while keeping the rest of the ontology intact |
| **Technical terms** | `create_technical_terms(domain, table_names?, user_instructions?, regenerate?)` | Generate table and column descriptions. Skips existing ones. With `regenerate=true`: DESTRUCTIVE, deletes and recreates |
| | `refine_foreign_keys(domain, user_instructions, table_names?)` | Add, modify or remove virtual foreign keys for existing tables in a technical domain. `user_instructions` is REQUIRED — describe what to add/modify/remove (TARGETED, e.g. "delete fk_x", "add fk from orders.customer_id to customers.id") or ask to detect missing FKs (DISCOVERY, e.g. "detect missing FKs in card_csv"); generic phrases ("review", "update") produce no changes. Tables without a previous technical term are skipped early with a warning. Idempotent: re-running the same instruction yields no changes. Returns `message`: a markdown summary in explicit `key=value` notation — per table `added=N, replaced=N, deleted=N, kept=N; persist=<ok\|failed\|not_needed>, BT=<updated\|unchanged>` (`not_needed` means the diff was empty so no PUT was sent), plus per-domain totals. The skill hands the markdown to the user as-is (no field parsing) |
| **Business views** | `create_business_views(domain, ontology, class_names?, regenerate?)` | Create views + mappings. Skips existing ones. With `regenerate=true`: DESTRUCTIVE, deletes and recreates |
| | `delete_business_views(domain, view_names)` | DESTRUCTIVE: delete specific views without recreating (protected by Published) |
| | `publish_business_views(domain, view_names?)` | Publish views (Draft -> Pending Publish). Without `view_names`, publishes all. Returns `published`, `failed` (transition not allowed), and `not_found`. Idempotent |
| **SQL Mappings** | `create_sql_mappings(domain, view_names?, user_instructions?)` | Create or update SQL mappings for existing views. Returns `message` (markdown summary) **and** `processed_views`: a list of BusinessViewSummary for the views actually processed in this call (excludes any names not found), each carrying `sql_mapping` — the freshly generated mapping SQL ready for sample-data validation (`SELECT * FROM (<sql_mapping>) AS m LIMIT 5`) without an extra `list_technical_domain_concepts` call |
| **Semantic terms** | `create_semantic_terms(domain, view_names?, user_instructions?, regenerate?)` | Generate semantic terms. `domain` accepts the technical name (`<domain>`, canonical and preferred in examples) **or** the semantic counterpart (`semantic_<domain>`) — both are normalized to the technical form. With `regenerate=true`: DESTRUCTIVE, deletes and recreates |
| | `refine_semantic_foreign_keys(domain, user_instructions, view_names?)` | Add, modify or remove the foreign key relations persisted as a `### Foreign Key Relations` markdown section in the business term of each semantic view. `domain` accepts the technical name (`<domain>`, canonical and preferred) **or** the semantic counterpart (`semantic_<domain>`) — both are normalized internally. `user_instructions` is REQUIRED — TARGETED ("Add an FK from orders.customer_id to customers.id") or DISCOVERY ("Detect missing FKs in orders and shipments"); generic phrases produce no changes. Refines any view that has a semantic business term, regardless of whether the view is published. Views without a semantic BT are skipped with a warning (run `create_semantic_terms` first). Only EN and ES are supported. Returns `message`: markdown summary in explicit `key=value` notation — per view `fk_count=N, persist=<ok\|failed>, BT=<updated\|unchanged>, columns_enriched=N`; skipped views as `**<view>**: skipped — <reason>`. Idempotent. The skill hands the markdown to the user as-is (no field parsing) |
| **Business terms** | `create_business_term(domain, name, description, type, related_assets)` | Create a business term in the dictionary with asset relationships |
| | `list_business_asset_types()` | List available asset types for business terms |
| **Collections** | `create_data_collection(collection_name, description, table_metadata_paths?, path_metadata_paths?)` | Create a data collection (technical domain) with tables and paths. `collection_name` without spaces (use underscores). Automatically refreshes the technical view |
| **Glossary instructions** | `get_glossary_instructions(domain, phases?, include_globals?)` | Read GenAI instruction-typed business terms from the data dictionary for a technical domain. Filterable by `phases` (list of `ontology` / `mapping` / `technical_terms` / `semantic_terms`; defaults to all four) and by `include_globals` for the cross-phase global `GenAI Instructions` type. For each phase, the response always includes the phase-specific primary type plus any additional per-phase types the profile has configured (mirrors what the chain consumes internally). Returns one section per glossary type with the raw Markdown content. Read-only. See §11 for the user-facing workflow |
| **Utility** | `list_technical_domain_concepts(domain)` | List existing business views with governance status (Draft/Pending Publish/Published), `has_sql_mapping` boolean, the actual mapping SQL in `sql_mapping` (when present — usable for sample-data validation: `SELECT * FROM (<sql_mapping>) AS m LIMIT 5`), and `has_semantic_terms` |
| | `create_collection_description(domain, user_instructions?)` | Generate ONLY the domain/collection description (without touching tables) |
| | `get_mcp_task_result(task_id)` | Retrieve the result of a long-running tool that continues executing in the background on the `gov` server (see §9 and `stratio-mcp-response-patterns.md` §1) |

### `sql` Server (domain exploration)

| MCP Tool | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `search_domains(search_text, domain_type?, refresh?)` | **Prefer over `list_domains`**. Search domains by free text (name or description). For technical domains: `domain_type='technical'`. For published semantic domains: `domain_type='business'`. Results sorted by relevance. Use when part of the name or topic is known |
| `list_domains(domain_type?, refresh?)` | List available domains. For technical domains: `domain_type='technical'` (includes description if it exists). For published semantic domains: `domain_type='business'` (prefix `semantic_`). `refresh` (boolean, default false): cache bypass — use after creating/deleting collections or when a recently published domain does not appear. Use only when you need to see all domains without filtering |
| `list_domain_tables(domain)` | List tables of a domain with their descriptions (indicates whether they have technical terms) |
| `get_tables_details(domain, tables)` | Table details: business rules, context |
| `get_table_columns_details(domain, table)` | Table columns: names, types, business descriptions |
| `search_domain_knowledge(question, domain)` | Search knowledge in technical and semantic domains |
| `search_data_dictionary(search_text, search_type?)` | Search tables and paths in the technical data dictionary. `search_type`: `'tables'`, `'paths'`, or `'both'` (default). Results sorted by relevance, with `metadata_path`, `name`, `subtype` (Table/Path), `alias`, `data_store`, `description` |
| `get_mcp_task_result(task_id)` | Retrieve the result of a long-running tool that continues executing in the background on the `sql` server (see §9 and `stratio-mcp-response-patterns.md` §1) |

## 3. Strict Rules

- **IMMUTABILITY of `domain_name`**: The `domain_name` parameter in ALL MCP calls must be **exactly** the value returned by `list_domains` or `search_domains`. NEVER translate, interpret, paraphrase, or infer it. If the domain is called `AnaliticaBanca`, use `"AnaliticaBanca"` — not `"Banca Particulares"`, not `"Analítica Banca"`, not `"banca"`. If in doubt about the exact name, call `search_domains` or `list_domains` again to confirm
- **Technical domains for creation, publishing and glossary instructions**: Creation tools (`create_technical_terms`, `create_ontology`, `create_business_views`, `create_sql_mappings`, `create_semantic_terms`), publishing (`publish_business_views`) and the read-only `get_glossary_instructions` (which feeds the same pipeline) all operate on **technical domains** — discover them with `list_domains(domain_type='technical')` or `search_domains(text, domain_type='technical')`. The technical name is the **canonical form preferred in examples and discovery**. **Tolerance**: `create_semantic_terms` and `refine_semantic_foreign_keys` additionally accept the `semantic_*` counterpart on input and normalize it to the technical form transparently — this lets an agent that already knows the published semantic domain name pass it directly without an extra discovery step. Other tools in this list remain strict (technical only); `get_glossary_instructions` in particular returns empty sections for `semantic_*` because GenAI instructions are stored against the technical collection. **Out of scope of this rule**: `create_business_term` is a **post-publication** operation, not part of the construction pipeline — it runs after the semantic layer is published and **prefers `semantic_<x>`** by default. See the dedicated rule below
- **Business terms domain selection (post-publication)**: `create_business_term` is invoked **after** the semantic layer is built and published, to document business concepts (KPIs, metrics, glossary entries). Default behavior:
  - **Prefer `semantic_<x>`** as `domain` whenever it exists. This files the term under "Semantic Knowledge" — the parent domain that business consumers see
  - **Apply the same prefix to all `related_assets`** — the chain rejects mixed prefixes
  - The **technical domain is fully supported** for the legitimate edge cases: physical-model artifacts, domains without a published semantic layer, or explicit user request. It is the exception in default flow, not a forbidden path
  - See the `manage-business-terms` skill for the full discovery procedure, decision rules, and examples
  - **Scope**: this rule applies **only** to `create_business_term`. All other governance tools listed in the construction-pipeline rule above continue to require technical domains
- **Semantic domains for exploration**: `list_domains(domain_type='business')`, `search_domains(text, domain_type='business')`, and `search_domain_knowledge` allow exploring already-published semantic layers
- **`user_instructions` built through the enrichment workflow**: For the four phase tools that accept `user_instructions` (`create_technical_terms`, `create_sql_mappings`, `create_semantic_terms`, and analogously the planning step of `create_ontology` / `update_ontology` even though the value is folded into the Markdown plan), build the value through the Glossary Instruction Enrichment Workflow described in §11. That workflow consolidates glossary instructions, optional external files (.owl/.ttl, business documents, CSVs, etc.) and free-text rules into a single text. **Never inject glossary content silently** without going through §11.2's user-facing question — the user must see and shape what is going to be applied. The enrichment is non-blocking: option 4 (skip) is always available. **Do not suggest options that the tool controls internally** (language, output format). For `create_collection_description`, which does not have a phase-specific glossary type, just offer free-text `user_instructions` directly (it is intentionally outside §11). For `refine_foreign_keys`, `user_instructions` is REQUIRED (the tool rejects empty input) — the enrichment workflow runs scoped to `phase=technical_terms` and the user's concrete refine intent (TARGETED or DISCOVERY) is concatenated on top of the enriched text before invoking the tool. The semantic counterpart `refine_semantic_foreign_keys` follows the same contract with the enrichment scoped to `phase=semantic_terms` instead of `technical_terms`; its `domain` parameter accepts both the technical name (canonical) and the `semantic_*` counterpart
- **Destructive operations (`regenerate=true`, `delete_*`)**: ALWAYS require explicit user confirmation with a clear warning of what will be lost. Pattern: detect existence -> inform what will be lost -> ask (skip/execute/cancel) -> additional confirmation for the destructive action
- **View publishing (`publish_business_views`)**: Confirm with the user by listing the views that will be published. Verify prior state with `list_technical_domain_concepts`. This is not destructive and does not require "destructive-type" confirmation, but it is a governance state change that the user must approve. Present the result: published views + failed + not found
- **Ontologies are ADD+DELETE**: `update_ontology` adds new classes. `delete_ontology_classes` deletes specific classes; `delete_ontology` deletes the entire ontology including all its classes — both are DESTRUCTIVE and protected (classes with dependent Published views are automatically skipped; published ontologies cannot be deleted). Existing classes cannot be modified
- **Best-effort delivery for `create_ontology` / `update_ontology`**: the optional `best_effort` argument lets the caller accept a sub-optimal ontology when the chain cannot fully validate the generated classes/views after all retries (and, for `create_ontology`, after the plan rebuild budget). It is opt-in and orthogonal to destructive operations: it does NOT override pre-generation failures (plan deemed unachievable with the available tables, table/size caps exceeded, governance services unreachable). Once a best-effort ontology has been persisted, retrying in strict mode requires `delete_ontology` first (for `create_ontology`) or `delete_ontology_classes` of the offending classes (for `update_ontology`). See §7 for the post-error recovery flow that drives the choice
- **Ontology naming**: No spaces (use underscores), no special characters
- **Collection naming**: No spaces (use underscores), no special characters — same convention as ontologies

## 4. Technical Domain Discovery Workflow

Steps to explore a technical domain before building its semantic layer.

### 4.1 Discover Technical Domains

**Prefer searching over listing** — `search_domains` returns relevant results without loading the full list (which can be very large).

If the user provides a domain or gives hints about the topic:
- Execute `search_domains(name_or_hint, domain_type='technical')` to search for matches
- If it matches a result -> use it directly and go to step 4.2
- If there are no matches -> execute `list_domains(domain_type='technical')` as a fallback and ask the user

If there is no clear domain, ask the user which one they are interested in. If the user gives no hints, execute `list_domains(domain_type='technical')` to show all available technical domains (present as selectable options).

If the user indicates they just created a collection and the domain does not appear, retry with `refresh=true` (cache bypass) before concluding it does not exist.

### 4.2 Explore Tables

`list_domain_tables(domain)` to list all tables in the domain. Tables with descriptions already have generated technical terms.

### 4.3 Table Details

For the tables of interest:
1. `get_tables_details(domain, table_names)` to obtain business rules and context
2. `get_table_columns_details(domain, table)` for columns, types, and descriptions

Launch 4.3 in parallel when dealing with independent tables.

### 4.4 Existing Knowledge

- `list_technical_domain_concepts(domain)` -> existing business views with mapping and semantic term status, plus the actual mapping SQL in `sql_mapping` when defined (usable for pre-publication sample-data validation against the data MCP)
- `search_ontologies(text)` or `list_ontologies` + `get_ontology_info` -> existing ontologies and their structure. Prefer `search_ontologies` if searching for a specific ontology
- `search_domain_knowledge(question, domain)` -> search terminology and definitions

## 5. Exploring Published Semantic Layers

When a generated semantic layer is approved in the Stratio Governance UI, it is published as a new business domain with the prefix `semantic_` (e.g., `semantic_mi_dominio`).

- `search_domains(text, domain_type='business')` -> **prefer**: search published semantic domains by name or description
- `list_domains(domain_type='business')` -> list all published semantic domains (fallback if search yields no results). If a recently published domain does not appear, retry with `refresh=true`
- `list_domain_tables(domain)` -> tables of the published semantic domain
- `search_domain_knowledge(question, domain)` -> search knowledge in technical or semantic domain

Useful for: ontology planning (see what has been done before), verifying the final result, helping the user understand the current state.

## 6. State Detection (Idempotency)

Before any operation, verify it does not already exist:

| Artifact | How to detect | If it already exists |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Data collection | `list_domains(domain_type='technical')` or `search_domains(name, domain_type='technical')` -> verify if the domain already exists. If just created and not appearing, use `refresh=true` | If it exists, inform. Options: use existing / create new with a different name |
| Technical terms | `list_domain_tables(domain)` -> tables with descriptions | Inform. Options: skip / regenerate (destructive) / cancel |
| Domain description | `list_domains(domain_type='technical')` -> whether the domain has a description | Inform. Options: skip / regenerate (destructive) / cancel |
| Ontology | `search_ontologies(name)` or `list_ontologies` + `get_ontology_info` | Options: extend (`update_ontology`, optionally with `best_effort=True`) / delete specific classes (`delete_ontology_classes`) / delete the entire ontology (`delete_ontology`) / create new (with a different name, or after `delete_ontology` on the previous one) |
| Business views | `list_technical_domain_concepts(domain)` | Inform of existing views. Options: skip / delete specific ones (`delete_business_views`) / regenerate (`create_business_views(regenerate=true)`) |
| View publishing | `list_technical_domain_concepts(domain)` -> status of each view | If already Pending Publish or Published, inform. Only Draft views can be published |
| SQL Mappings | `list_technical_domain_concepts(domain)` -> mapping status per view + `sql_mapping` of the mapping when present | `create_sql_mappings` overwrites existing mappings. Use `sql_mapping` for pre-publication sample validation (see §4 of `stratio-data-tools.md`) |
| Semantic terms | `list_technical_domain_concepts(domain)` -> term status per view | Inform. Options: skip / regenerate (destructive) / cancel |

> When any `search_*` tool above is unavailable (not empty, but failing), substitute per §10 and continue.

## 7. Error Handling and Recovery

### 7.1 Generic recovery

- Analyze the error -> try to diagnose the cause
- If the agent can resolve it -> retry with improved `user_instructions` (reformulate, add specific context)
- If it cannot -> ask the user what additional context to provide -> pass it as `user_instructions` in the retry
- Retry ONLY the failed entity (specific table, class, or view), not the entire batch
- Maximum 2 retries per entity. If it persists -> document in the summary and continue with the rest

### 7.2 Ontology generation failure with a valid plan (post-plan-validation recovery)

When `create_ontology` or `update_ontology` returns an error **after the plan has already been validated** — i.e. the chain produced (or partially produced) classes/views but the supervisors kept rejecting them — the recovery is different from the generic "improve `user_instructions` and retry" loop above. In that scenario the agent **must present the user with the following options and let them pick**, then execute the chosen sequence of tool calls.

> Distinction first: when the response message says the failure happened **before any class was generated** — typical wordings are about the requested plan being infeasible with the available tables, missing required tables in the data domain, the request exceeding table/size limits, or the chain being unable to validate the plan — the ontology was **not** persisted. There is nothing to clean up. Simply re-call `create_ontology` with an adjusted plan (narrow the scope, fix table names, simplify relationships); do **not** enter the A-F flow below.

| Option | Steps | When to choose it |
|---|---|---|
| **A — Clean and retry with best-effort** | `delete_ontology(name)` → `create_ontology(name, plan, best_effort=True)` | The plan looks right and the user accepts a sub-optimal ontology with warnings instead of more retries. |
| **B — Complete what's missing via update with best-effort** | `update_ontology(name, update_plan_for_missing_classes, best_effort=True)` | The base ontology was created but classes/views are missing because of partial failures. Add-only: completes the gap without touching what already worked. |
| **C — Complete what's missing via update in strict mode** | `update_ontology(name, corrected_update_plan)` (no `best_effort`) | The base ontology is fine but a few classes failed, and the user is willing to tweak the update plan (rename columns, simplify relationships) so the new classes pass quality validation. |
| **D — Clean and retry with a corrected plan** | `delete_ontology(name)` → `create_ontology(name, corrected_plan)` (no `best_effort`) | Structural problems in the original plan — start from scratch with a different plan in strict mode. |
| **E — Just clean** | `delete_ontology(name)` (no recreate) | The user wants to wipe the failed attempt and stop here (reflect, consult their team, manually fix in Governance later). |
| **F — Leave as-is and review/fix manually in Governance UI** | (no tool call) | The user accepts the partial ontology and will refine it manually through the Governance UI without further chain involvement. |

**Confirmation rule (non-negotiable):** before invoking `delete_ontology` (options A, D, E) **always** ask the user for an explicit confirmation that names the ontology being deleted. The `destructiveHint=True` MCP annotation is informative, not enforcement; confirmation is the agent's responsibility.

**Choosing C vs D:** if only specific classes failed and the rest of the ontology is healthy, prefer C (cheaper and non-destructive). If the failure is transversal or the base structure is wrong, prefer D. The agent may suggest a default based on what failed, but the user makes the final call.

**Choosing A/D vs B/C:** A and B accept best-effort delivery to finish the flow; C and D enforce quality at the cost of further halts. Surface the trade-off when presenting the options.

## 8. Parallel Execution

- **Read tools** (`list_*`, `get_*`, `search_*`): Launch in parallel whenever they are independent
- **Creation**: Sequential within the same phase
- **Between phases**: Strict mandatory sequence: technical terms -> ontology -> business views -> SQL mappings -> (optional publishing) -> semantic terms. Each phase depends on the artifacts from the previous one. Publishing can be done after completing mappings or at any later point

**"In parallel" here means emitting multiple tool calls **within the same phase** in the SAME response so the runtime executes them concurrently — NOT spawning subtasks, sub-sessions, or invoking the Task tool, and NOT mixing tool calls from different phases. Never delegate governance MCP calls to a subagent (full rule: `stratio-mcp-response-patterns.md` §3).**

## 9. MCP Response Patterns

Two response patterns can occur on **any** MCP tool listed in §2, on either the `gov` or `sql` server. The protocols are in `stratio-mcp-response-patterns.md` — apply them whenever the trigger appears. For polling, always call `get_mcp_task_result` on the **same server** as the original tool. On `status="error"`, apply the recovery strategy from §7.

| Trigger | Companion section |
|---------|-------------------|
| Response contains only a `task_id` field (no data, no error) | `stratio-mcp-response-patterns.md` §1 — Long-Running Task Polling |
| Response replaced by a truncation notice + a saved file path, no `task_id` | `stratio-mcp-response-patterns.md` §2 — Large Tool Outputs Truncated |

## 10. OpenSearch Availability Fallback

`search_domains`, `search_ontologies` and `search_data_dictionary` consult OpenSearch internally. OpenSearch may not be available in every environment. This section defines the fallback when any of these tools is unavailable — distinct from the *empty result* fallback already described in §4.1 and §5.

### 10.1 Case detection

| Situation | Indicator | Fallback path |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Empty result (already documented) | Tool returns a well-formed response with zero matches | §4.1 / §5 — call the corresponding `list_*` and ask the user |
| Unavailability (new) | Error response mentioning OpenSearch / index / connection / timeout, **or** two successive retries per §7 still fail (not a `task_id` pending per §9) | §10.2 |

### 10.2 Deterministic fallback

| OpenSearch tool | Deterministic alternative | Coverage |
|-----------------|---------------------------|----------|
| `search_domains(search_text, domain_type?)` | `list_domains(domain_type?)` + local substring filter over `name` and `description` | Complete |
| `search_ontologies(search_text)` | `list_ontologies()` + local substring filter over `name` and `description` | Complete |
| `search_data_dictionary(search_text, search_type?)` | With a domain hint: `list_domain_tables(domain)` + `get_tables_details(domain, tables)`. Without a domain hint: `list_domains(domain_type='technical')` → ask the user to pick one → continue | Partial — no cross-domain free-text search without OpenSearch |

### 10.3 Procedure

1. On first detected unavailability in the session, announce the degradation to the user once — per tool, not per call.
2. Invoke the deterministic alternative.
3. Continue the workflow (non-blocking). The §6 state-detection checks still apply: if `search_ontologies(name)` is used for idempotency, substitute with `list_ontologies` + local filter. The §7 retry budget is consumed before declaring unavailability.
4. Stop only if the alternative cannot cover the user's need — typically `search_data_dictionary` without a domain hint when the user cannot narrow the scope. In that case, inform the user and halt this sub-task.
5. Note the degradation in the summary at the end of the phase.

## 11. Glossary Instruction Enrichment Workflow

Some technical domains carry **GenAI instructions** authored by data stewards in the Stratio Governance UI as typed business terms in the data dictionary. These instructions guide how the LLM generates ontologies, SQL mappings, technical terms and semantic terms for that domain. They come in two scopes:

- **Global** — applicable across phases (default type: `GenAI Instructions`).
- **Phase-specific** — one type per phase: `GenAI Ontology Instructions`, `GenAI Mapping Instructions`, `GenAI Technical Term Instructions`, `GenAI Semantic Term Instructions`. A profile may also configure additional global types per phase.

Historically these were consumed implicitly inside the chain. The `get_glossary_instructions` tool exposes them so the agent can show them to the user, discuss them, mix them with an external file, or skip them — *before* calling any creation tool that accepts `user_instructions`.

### 11.1 When to apply

- In any phase skill that is about to invoke `create_technical_terms`, `create_ontology` / `update_ontology`, `create_sql_mappings` or `create_semantic_terms` — **right before** the existing `user_instructions` step.
- Once at the beginning of a full pipeline run driven by `build-semantic-layer`, covering all phases included in the proposed plan; the resulting per-phase enriched text is reused by the sub-skills without asking again.

`create_collection_description` is intentionally **outside** this workflow: it has no phase-specific glossary type associated, so the agent simply offers free-text `user_instructions` directly when invoking it.

### 11.2 Ask the user

Following the agent's user-question convention, present these four mutually-exclusive options:

1. Use only the **specific** glossary instructions for this phase.
2. Use **specific + global** glossary instructions.
3. Provide an **external file** (local path) instead of (or in addition to) the glossary.
4. **Skip** — proceed without instruction enrichment.

When the workflow is run from `build-semantic-layer`, scope the question to "for the phases in the proposed plan" and treat the user's answer as the policy for all of them; offer a per-phase override only if the user explicitly asks.

### 11.3 Read from glossary (options 1 and 2)

Invoke `get_glossary_instructions` for the current domain and the relevant phase(s):

- `domain` — **always the technical domain** that feeds the pipeline. The four phase tools (`create_technical_terms`, `create_ontology`, `create_sql_mappings`, `create_semantic_terms`) operate on the technical collection, and so does `get_glossary_instructions`. Passing a `semantic_*` domain returns empty sections because GenAI instructions are not stored on the published semantic domain.
- `phases` — the current phase if invoked from a phase skill, or the list of phases included in the plan when invoked from `build-semantic-layer`.
- `include_globals` — choose according to the option the user picked:
  - **Option 1 (specific only)**: `include_globals=false`. Returns only the phase-specific instruction types for each requested phase (primary + any additional per-phase types configured by the profile).
  - **Option 2 (specific + globals)**: `include_globals=true`. Same as option 1 plus the cross-phase global `GenAI Instructions` type.

Show the user a compact summary of what came back (one entry per `(glossary_type, scope)` section, item count or content preview on demand). Ask whether they want to:

- accept everything as-is,
- exclude any specific items from a section,
- add their own free-text comments on top.

If the response carries `error` or all sections are empty, inform the user and offer to fall back to option 3 or 4.

### 11.4 Read from external file (option 3)

Ask for a local path. Read the file with the appropriate skill: Markdown / TXT directly, DOCX via `/docx-reader`, PPTX via `/pptx-reader`, PDF via `/pdf-reader`. Extract the relevant text; do not invent content not present in the file.

Option 3 may be combined with options 1 or 2 if the user wants to layer both sources.

### 11.5 Consolidation

Combine the chosen sources into a single Markdown text with explicit headings: a section for the global glossary instructions, a section per phase-specific glossary type, a section for external-file content, and a section for free-text comments the user added. Empty sections may be omitted.

How the consolidated text is consumed depends on the target MCP tool:

- For `create_technical_terms`, `create_sql_mappings`, `create_semantic_terms`: pass it directly as the `user_instructions` argument.
- For `create_ontology` / `update_ontology`: those tools do **not** accept `user_instructions` today. The consolidated text is incorporated into the Markdown `ontology_plan` / `update_plan` that the agent prepares before calling the tool — it shapes class proposals, naming conventions, relationships, etc. If a future version of the tool starts accepting `user_instructions`, the same text will also be passed through. The optional `best_effort` argument (see §2, §3 and §7.2) is **orthogonal** to the consolidated plan/instructions — enrichment shapes the input, `best_effort` shapes how rejections are handled at the output side.

### 11.6 Reuse from orchestrator pre-load

When `build-semantic-layer` has already executed this workflow at the start of the pipeline, the per-phase enriched text is part of the planning context for the run. Phase sub-skills must:

1. Detect that pre-loaded enrichment already exists for their phase and reuse it as `user_instructions` without asking the four options again.
2. Optionally ask the user a single short question — whether they want to add anything specific to this phase on top of the pre-loaded enrichment — and append the answer to the consolidated text if any.

If a phase skill is invoked **outside** the orchestrator (direct user request), it runs §11.2–§11.5 on its own.

### 11.7 No silent enrichment

Never invoke `get_glossary_instructions` and inject the result as `user_instructions` without going through §11.2 (or the orchestrator's equivalent question). The whole point of the workflow is that the user sees and can shape what is going to be applied.
