description: "Create or regenerate technical terms — descriptions of tables and columns — in Stratio Governance for an entire technical domain, and seed the collection description when missing. Use when the user wants to document tables and columns, bulk-generate descriptions for a new domain, refresh them after schema changes, or recover missing technical terms."

# Skill: Create Technical Terms

Creates technical descriptions for tables and columns of a domain in Stratio Governance. Phase 1 of the semantic layer pipeline.

## MCP Tools Used

| Tool | Server | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `search_domains(search_text, domain_type='technical')` | sql | **Prefer**. Search technical domains by free text. Results by relevance |
| `list_domains(domain_type='technical', refresh?)` | sql | List all technical domains (includes description if exists). `refresh=true` for cache bypass |
| `list_domain_tables(domain)` | sql | List tables with their descriptions (indicates if they already have technical terms) |
| `create_technical_terms(domain, table_names?, user_instructions?, regenerate?)` | gov | Create technical terms. Skips existing. With `regenerate=true`: DESTRUCTIVE, deletes and recreates |

**Key rules**: `domain_name` immutable (exact value from `list_domains` or `search_domains`). Mandatory confirmation for `regenerate=true`. Build `user_instructions` through the Glossary Instruction Enrichment Workflow (`guides/stratio-semantic-layer-tools.md` §11) before invoking.

## Workflow

### 1. Determine domain

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a domain name, search with `search_domains($ARGUMENTS, domain_type='technical')`. If it matches a result, continue. If it does not match, retry with `search_domains($ARGUMENTS, domain_type='technical', refresh=true)` in case it is a recently created collection. If it now matches, continue. If it still does not match or there is no argument, list domains with `list_domains(domain_type='technical')` and ask the user following the user question convention.

### 2. Evaluate state

Execute `list_domain_tables(domain)` to evaluate the current state:
- Tables with description → already have generated technical terms
- Tables without description → pending generation
- If the domain has a description (visible in `list_domains(domain_type='technical')`) → the general description already exists

Present summary to the user:
```
## State — [domain_name]
- Total tables: N
- With technical terms: X
- Pending: Y
- Domain description: Yes/No
```

### 3. Scope selection

Ask the user with options:
1. **Create for all tables** — idempotent: `create_technical_terms` skips tables that already have a description
2. **Create for specific tables** — multiple selection from pending tables
3. **Regenerate all** — DESTRUCTIVE: deletes and recreates. Requires explicit confirmation
4. **Regenerate specific tables** — DESTRUCTIVE for the selected ones. Requires explicit confirmation

### 4. Glossary instruction enrichment

Before invoking the MCP tool, apply the Glossary Instruction Enrichment Workflow described in `guides/stratio-semantic-layer-tools.md` §11, scoped to **technical terms** (i.e., when calling `get_glossary_instructions`, request only the technical terms phase).

If the orchestrator already pre-loaded enriched instructions for this phase during the `build-semantic-layer` flow, reuse them instead of asking again — optionally ask the user whether they want to add anything specific to this phase on top of what was pre-loaded.

The enriched text becomes the `user_instructions` argument of the MCP call in the next step. If the user chose option 4 (skip), `user_instructions` is omitted.

### 5. Execution

Invoke `create_technical_terms`. To regenerate: pass `regenerate=true` (DESTRUCTIVE). The tool returns a summary of what was processed — present that summary to the user directly. Do not call additional tools post-creation to avoid filling up context.

**Note on domain description**: `create_technical_terms` automatically generates the domain/collection description if it does not have one. It is not necessary to call `create_collection_description` as a separate step.

### 6. Summary

Based on the tool's response, present:
- Tables processed
- Errors if any: for ordinary failures, retry the failed entity with improved `user_instructions` (max 2 retries). **Exception — data-precondition errors are NOT retryable** (`guides/stratio-semantic-layer-tools.md` §7.3): if the message means the collection has no tables, or its tables have **no columns** in the governance catalog (the technical view was not refreshed) — recognise this by the meaning of the message, not a literal string — **do not retry**. Present the message's guidance (refresh/verify the collection's technical view in Stratio Governance; the agent has no tool to do it) and stop. If only **some** tables came back without columns, report which tables were skipped and why (the rest were processed)
- Suggested next steps:
  - "You can create an ontology with `/create-ontology`"
  - "If you need to fix, add or remove individual virtual foreign keys without regenerating the technical terms, use `/refine-foreign-keys`"
